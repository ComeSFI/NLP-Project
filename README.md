# NLP-Project
Original data is not uuploaded because too heavy

#Progress
I didn't end the project because i started it to late but here is my progress
i chose the dataset :Rottten tomatoes movie reviews. I did the exploratory data analysis and will upload it soon.
I did the preprocessing pipelines and made some choices about what to use. Due to my database being huge, its very long to do the processing. thinking about taking of the lematizer
Got a first model but not very good one to improve
